# QGRNN: Feature Fusion-Based Hybrid Quantum-Classical Graph Residual Neural Network
This repository provides the reference implementation of QGRNN, a hybrid quantum–classical graph residual neural network developed to enhance node representation learning.

QGRNN integrates three key components:

- A GAT-based classical feature extractor,
- A parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) module for targeted nonlinear enhancement,
- A gated residual fusion mechanism that adaptively combines classical and quantum embeddings.

This implementation includes the complete architectural design of QGRNN and demonstrates its end-to-end training workflow on the Cora node classification task.
